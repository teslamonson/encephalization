Encephalization is lauded as a defining feature of our genus. However, new fossils provide evidence of brain and body size diversification among Plio-Pleistocene hominids that demands testing this dominant paradigm. We conducted the most comprehensive analysis of allometric scaling in primates to date using data for brain and body size of 225 extant primate species and 18 fossil hominid* taxa. Our results demonstrate that encephalization does not increase after 3 Ma (lm, p > 0.05), and humans are not more encephalized than other Pleistocene hominids (Grubbs’ test, p > 0.05). Brain:body size relationships are allometrically scaled in extant primates (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.001) and hominids (R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001), with a significantly steeper slope of allometric scaling in hominids (F = 5.26 (1, 236), p = 0.023). All hominids after 3 Ma, including the smallest and most robust taxa, share allometrically-scaled brain:body size proportions. In contrast to currently held views that encephalization has increased gradually throughout later hominid evolution, our results demonstrate that derived allometric scaling of brain:body size evolved once in hominids, around 3 Ma in the Late Pliocene. Human-like encephalization is thus shared among all Pleistocene fossil hominids and evolved much earlier than currently presumed. We hypothesize that a fundamental biological shift ca. 3 Ma altered the trajectory of hominid encephalization and is directly implicated in the evolution of complex symbolic behavior in our lineage.
